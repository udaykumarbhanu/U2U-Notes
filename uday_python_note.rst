# Short note

Big-O Complexity: 
http://cooervo.github.io/Algorithms-DataStructures-BigONotation/

If there are more than one option for complexity in same code, then choose which is worst.

Python Language Essentials:

1. The Python Interpreter:
Python in an interpreted language.The Python interpreter runs a program by executing one statement at a time.


DS:

Interfaces: An nterface describes what a data structure does, while an implementation describes how the data structure does it. An interface, sometimes also called an abstract data type, defines the set of operations supported by a data structure and the semantics, or meaning, of those operations. An interface tells us nothing about how the data structure implements these operations; it only provides a list of supported operations along with specifications about what types of arguments
each operation accepts and the value returned by each operation.

A DS(data structure) implementation, on the other hand, includes the internal representation of the data structure as well as the definitions of the algorithms that implement the operations supported by the data structure.
